#The baugarten constitution
"Vigeamus ubi orta libertas"


##Preambel
Creative minds of Europe, awake! We midwives of creativity are giving birth to a community of new work-forms that will storm the world of work.

Baugarten is a vigorous garden of building. We are the place where, in the early morning of a work day, you are *excited* to go. We are a self-governing space of free exploits, free invention, exploration, experimentation, learning, teaching, thinking, poetry, failure and victory.

##Assembly
####When we meet
We personally gather for 15-30 minutes every two weeks on Wednesday at 0900 to discuss decisions together.

##Meeting Protocol
The moderator starts the meeting. He applies the following protocol and asks the following questions:

1. Check-In. "How are you today?" Each participant has 1 minute to tell about him or herself.
2. News. "Who has news today, about your own project or about baugarten?" If you have news, you can explain it briefly (maximum 2 minutes).
3. The moderator explains which proposals will come into effect after their 2-week discussion period and which members they will launch.
4. Discuss new suggestions. See "2nd Step: Discuss a Proposal at an Assembly" for a detailed minutes of discussion, in this case a new or current committee proposal. The moderator explains which proposals will come into effect after their 2-week discussion period and which members are bringing them to life.
5. Check-Out. Each participant can briefly say something as a final word, for example, "I liked the speed of this meeting". 1 minute.

##Consensus-based decision-making
![Entscheidungsverfahren.png](Entscheidungsverfahren.png)
What motivates us? How do we make decisions as a collective that move and excite each of us to action?

We use systemic consensus to make decisions that unite our different voices, move us, and unleash the momentum of our collective forces.

###Committees
If we find a way to improve, then we form a committee to explore this issue. The committee publishes a proposal in the Loomio Tool (see below).

After the Baugarten-collective either rejects the proposal or it enter into force - and the committee and yes-voting members have completed the corresponding project tasks - the committee dissolves.

###1st Step: Share suggestions online at Slack with Loomio
A committee has two steps to get a proposal moving. The first step is to distribute the proposal as a "thread" on the Loomio online tool. At Loomio, all members of the Baugarten family can view, question and criticize the proposal for **two weeks**. As a thread, the committee has several polls and voting tools to solicit objections and creative solutions.

We use the online Loomio tool for two reasons:

Reason # 1: To create a record of our decisions and our conversations.
Reason # 2: Because it often happens that one or the other Baugarten-member is missing on Wednesday at the personal meeting. Through Loomio, these members also have the opportunity to comment on proposals.

####Create a thread on Loomio
On Loomio, make a proposal on the creating thread.
Over the Slack "rule" channels the Baugarten-members see the new suggestion. To do this you write about their comments.

###2nd Step: Discuss proposal at meeting
The second and final step for a committee to bring a proposal to life and into force is to submit it in a personal assembly meeting. For that conversation, we have the following order of discussion:

1. Present proposal - The committee describes the problem he saw and the solution he proposes
2. Clarify questions - anyone can ask questions. The committee can answer
3. Reaction Round - Any person can respond to the proposal as they see fit. No discussion or answers
4. Amendment and explanation - The committee may optionally clarify the intention or change the proposal based on the reactions. No discussion allowed
5. Loomio Vote and Objection Round - The moderator reads the Loomio vote so far registered (see the four possible votes below). Members who have raised an objection explain their objections and what they do with the committee to find a creative solution together. There is no discussion unless a member has vetoed. In that case all members will check together if the veto is justified. There are three options after that:

#####The veto is justified
If members find this veto justified, then the proposal is rejected. Of course, the committee can meet again to reformulate a new proposal that addresses the veto.

#####There are disagreements within the group about whether the veto is justified
In the case of widely differing views on veto enforcement, the assembled members are looking for an appointment to discuss different vision views on Baugarten together. This allows us to understand why there is a misunderstanding.

##### The veto is not justified
If members find the veto unjustified, the vote is categorized as "No and ...".

It is helpful in the personal gathering when the community creates a space of trust and listening, and when members find the courage to be honest.

### 3rd Step: Committee integration in case of objections
In the event that there are one or more objections, the negative members agree to discuss their objections with the committee. The aim is to develop an amended proposal that does not raise the objection but nevertheless achieves the objective / problem of the applicant. Focus on each objection in turn.

#### find consensus - by voting protocol
Instead of a yes / no vote - overcoming and overriding the voices of minority positions - we use a systemic consensus finding protocol built into Loomio, which fathoms the strength of resistance of each member against the proposal.

**Yes** (Loomio "Agree") - I want us to put this proposal into effect. I have the same need and I'm participating in bringing this solution/project to life.
**Abstain** (Loomio "Abstain") - I agree with the committee and their respective proposal. At the same time, the proposal does not concern me, or I do not think it's important, or I'm not participating in bringing it to life. I abstain from carrying it out, but I'm on board with it happening. I respect the decision of the committee. If you have not created another vote in Loomio within the two-week comment period, your vote will automatically be counted as "Abstain".

**Objection**
**No, and ...** (Loomio "Disagree") - I do not want us to implement this proposal. Although I may understand the need of the committee, I havean objection to the way in which the committee wishes to implement this proposal. ** "And ... what if" **: I agree to propose an alternative. I commit myself by submitting this vote, to find a creative alternative solution together with the committee.

After the two opposing parties have come to a solution, the committee will publish a fresh, updated proposal for a second round of commentary.

**Veto** - (Loomio "Block") I think that this decision contradicts the constitution or the meaning of baugarten as a free collective. In the case of a veto, all members examine together whether this veto is justified in this context. (See "Step 2: Discuss proposal at meeting" for the minutes).

## Free thinking, free writing
The beginning of thinking is disagreement. Communities that approach the spirit of open-minded inquiry and constructive disagreement flourish. Disagreement, independent judgment and questioning assumptions flourish within an environment of diverse views and the greatest freedom.

Baugarten guarantees all those who enjoy the greatest possible freedom to think, to express themselves, to write, to challenge and to question. We are a discordant symphony, a clashing theater, a college and a parliament of free thought
