#Free Discussion Code of Conduct

_A template for groups that want to debate ideas freely and openly, have fun and get stuff done_

Most human groups throughout history have lacked tolerance for criticism and the threat of new ideas. Communities like Plato’s Academy that are open to asking all questions are rare. This code of conduct is a continuation of this peculiar free-expression tradition.

##Preamble
The beginning of thought is disagreement: Conflict is key to creating knowledge. Communities that nurture constructive disagreement, viewpoint diversity and open inquiry, thrive.

 Disagreement, independent judgment, and the questioning of stubborn assumptions flourish in an environment of the greatest freedom.

[Community] therefore guarantees all members the greatest freedom to think, speak, write, listen, challenge and learn. 

##Our Culture & Organization
We organize ourselves neither as an autocracy of particular views, nor as a democracy. We are an idea meritocracy. Through:
- spirited conversation
- thoughtful argument and constructive disagreement
- contradiction, provocation and refutation 
- epistemological modesty and an openness to being proven wrong
- exploratory as opposed to confirmatory thinking
- and daring to think and express a diversity of conflicting ideas

we play the “game” of truth-seeking. 

We practice the Principle of Charity in our exchanges: we interpret fellow member’s statements in their best, most reasonable form. We also practice and take inspiration from Rapoport’s Rules of Argument: before you rebut a criticism, reexpress your opponent’s position, list points of agreement and point out what you have learned.

No matter how charitably or respectfully arguments are presented, entering this community also means that you might have your ideas and values challenged, criticized and attacked. “However true [your idea or value] may be, if it is not fully, frequently and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth.” 

We value respect and politeness, but we value getting closer to the truth more. 

##Interpersonal Conflict
There are situations in which personal conflict inhibits the progress of the project. In these cases, the first step is to speak with the individual group member(s) yourself.

Explore what the disagreement is about. Is it technical or personal? Is it a problem of communication or of substance? 

If you cannot solve your differences together in person, we will find a third-party mediator to help you find a solution. This could mean exploring new ways to practice disagreement and how to constructively express one’s emotions. The mediator can be part of, or external to, the group.

If the mediation fails, final options include one or both parties leaving the group or brainstorming an alternative creative solution together.

##Conclusion 
From the Ancient Greeks to the Scientific Revolution, to your debates with buddies in high school, cultures that created a space for productive disagreement and conflict have driven people and projects forward. These elements make working in groups exciting, challenging, surprising, and fun. 

This Code of Conduct is a template for your community to practice discussion and argument in this powerful and peculiar free-expression tradition.
